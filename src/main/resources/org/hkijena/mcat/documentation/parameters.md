# Algorithm parameters

MCAT allows you to define and run multiple parameter sets at once. On the left-hand
side is a table that contains all parameter sets as rows. On selecting a row in the 
list you can edit the parameters on the right-hand side.
 
You can either add new rows or generate rows based on the currently selected column.
