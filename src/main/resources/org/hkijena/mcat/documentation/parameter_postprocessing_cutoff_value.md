# Cutoff value

This parameter defines how many time frames should be omitted from the beginning of a kinetic curve when calculating area under the curve (AUC) statistics. The cutoff is specified as portion of the curve, e.g. a cutoff value 0.2 means the first 20% of time frames are ignored. If this parameter is set to 0, the AUC is calculated for the entire curve.
