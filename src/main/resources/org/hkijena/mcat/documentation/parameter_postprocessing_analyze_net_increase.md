Defines if all kinetic cluster centers with a signal net increase should be used for AUC calculation.

If it is enabled, a weighted curve is calculated for each subject with the weights being the corresponding pixel abundance values for all kinetic cluster centers with a signal net increase. These curves are then normalized by the total number of pixels of the respective subjects and the AUC is calculated, taken into account the cutoff value.
