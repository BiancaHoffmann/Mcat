Defines how many kinetic cluster centers are extracted. 

This parameter controls how many cluster centers are used when performing k-means clustering. Smaller values can lead to bad approximation of the true kinetics present in the image, while larger values can lead to overfitting to confined regions with possibly strongly fluctuating signal intensities. Depending on the biological question, a value between 3 and 10 might be a good starting point.
